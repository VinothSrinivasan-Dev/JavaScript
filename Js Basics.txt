/*
Everything in javascript stored in Execition Context 

It has 2 components 

1. Memory(Varaiable Environment)
  --> here only all our varaible and functions will be there 
2.Code(Thread Of Execution)
   --> Here Our code will be run line by line 

   
Javascript Synchoronus and single - threaded langugae


What happens inside the JS Engine when you trigger a JS Program 

*/

//Sample Program to Understanding the Js engine 
var n =2;
function square(n){
  var ans= n*n;
  return ans;
}

var square2 = square(2);
var square4= square(4);

console.log(square2,square4)

/*Two components will be created 


1.Memory Creation phase  
 
Note : if it is varaibale assign as undefined 
If it a func store whole function 

n  : undefined 
square : {..whole code of func..}

square2: undefined
square4:: undeined

**************************************

2. Code Execution Phase
(Line by line code will be run )

Now in Memory Creation Phase,
n: 2

In function invocation of sqaure2 

new Execution context wil be created in Code  Execution Phase 

Phase 1: (Memory allocation)
num: undefined
ans: undefined 

Phase 2: (Code Execution phase)
Now in phase 2 values are assigned 
num : 2
ans : 4

Note :  Whole execuion context inside code phase wil be deleted .
it will run based on how many fns invoked

**************************************
Values are assinged
square2: 4
square4: 16


************************************
Once evenrything run whole execution context will be deleted ...

It handled the Execution context creation ,deletion knows as Call Stack 

Call Stack --> its a Stack (Bottonof stacj we are have  Global Execution context)
--> Call Stack maintains the order of Execution of execution contexts
Call Stack known for 
1.Execution Context Stack
2.Program Stack
3.Control Stack
4.Runtime Stack
5.Machine stack

//Here One thing we need to under stand before initializing the function we are invoking we are getting the output as we expected 
//But for variable  not defined if we are not defini x means , if you are defins var x=7; means t will undefined.


//if we are accesing arrow fn before it initialzes 
console.log(getNameArrow);//getting getName is not a function act as varible only since we are storing into value

//Window -- Its a global objecy which is created along with Global Execution Contxt

// at global level this === window

//any variable outside the function it was accesible by globally using window.va and this.

*********************************************

//Lexical  Example
function a(){

var b=10;

//output :10

function a1(){
  var d=10;

//Lexical Environmenr is a local memory and its  reference to its lexical environment parent 


******************************************************
// Let and Const 

//Let & const in JavaScript behave differently when they are Hoisted. Understanding the difference between var, let and const in JS will help you write better code. const and let are in  a Temporal Dead Zone until they are initialized some value. You might encounter SyntaxError, TypeError or ReferenceError while using them in your code.
// console.log(b);

let a=10;
console.log(a);
// var b=100;

//let and const are allocated memory in different memory space

//Here var alone attached to window but let and const are not attached to global scope becox it was present in differnt memory

//In let and const we can't do the dupliation declration

const b = 1000;

//In const we cannot assign value later after declartion

//Type Error 
// b= 90; 

//Syntax Error 
// const v;


//Let and const are block scope 

//{} -- Block  is also known as compound statement
let y = 900;
if(true){
//What are variable and functions are access inside this block called block scope.
var x =10;
let y =20;
const z= 30;
console.log(x,y,z);//Here x was shadowed and also modified the outer x value 
}
console.log(y);

//Here var was shadowed and update the value 
//but let and const inside block differnt value outside the block different value 


***********************************************


//illega Shadowing let to var 

let a=10;
{
  let a=20;
  console.log(a);
}
console.log(a);

//Lexical Scope

const b= 10;
{
  const b=20;
  {
    // const b =30
 
  }
   console.log(b);
}

//Arrow function scope

//Here also same scope like other
